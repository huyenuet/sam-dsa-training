### Approach
- init smallest and largest number
- traverse through the list, if there's any number is bigger than largest_number, assign this number to largest_number
- if there's any number is smaller than smallest_number, assign this number to smallest_number

### Efficiency
- Time complexity: O(n)
- Space complexity: O(1)
