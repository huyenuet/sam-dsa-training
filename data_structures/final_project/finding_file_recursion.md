## why did you use that data structure?
 Because it's required. I'm not sure if recursion is a data structure
 

## The efficiency (time and space) of your solution.
I went down to every directory or file to check if it's the file I'm looking for

- Time complexity is O(n)
- Space complexity is O(n). Because state of each recursion function call was stored (I guess?)
