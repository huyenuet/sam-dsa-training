## why did you use that data structure?
solution: Recursion

Because:
- There's a stop condition: found the user
- if not found the user, keep traverse to all sub-groups

## The efficiency (time and space) of your solution.

- Time complexity is O(n)
- Space complexity is O(n). Because state of each recursion function call was stored (I guess?)
